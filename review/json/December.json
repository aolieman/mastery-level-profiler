                "summary": "C-K design theory or concept-knowledge theory is both a design theory and a theory of reasoning in design. It defines design reasoning as a logic of expansion processes, i.e. a logic that organizes the generation of unknown objects. The theory builds on several traditions of design theory, including systematic design, axiomatic design, creativity theories, general design theories, and artificial intelligence-based design models."

Characteristics include inconsistent letterspacing, varying typeweights within single words and type set at unusual angles. http://www. aiga. org/content. cfm?contentalias=AprilGreiman Credit for the introduction of New Wave design is given to Wolfgang Weingart.

                "summary": "Design comics are a type of storyboarding used in product and web site design. Design comics include product consumers or other characters in an illustrated story that shows how the users interact with the product. This method of storytelling is closely related to basic storyboarding, but because design comics include one or more characters in the story, many designers find them to be a better medium to communicate user experiences."
